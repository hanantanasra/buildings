dataset and results
Here we share a dataset of furnished and unfurnsihed bathroom rooms. Image size is 256/256; About Dataset

Edit
The dataset is composed of two files : with_frn and without_frn.
pairs of colored images in two primary variants: The furnished bathrooms represent the ground-truth images that the ML models are expected to learn;
the second with empty rooms that only have doors and windows, to represent the userâ€™s input.
The furniture objects are represented in label colors to minimize object complexity and maximize the learning process of image generative models.
